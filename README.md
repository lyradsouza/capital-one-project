Challenge description:

Capital One’s mission is to change banking for good. We want customers to make informed, beneficial decisions that are appropriate for their financial situation. Bringing transparency to credit and banking is critical. We propose a challenge to aggregate and simplify financial offers on websites or through downloaded text so that consumers can weed out marketing jargon, avoid hidden fees, and make more educated credit and banking decisions. Text summarization is a component of natural language processing (NLP) and used in machine learning systems. We suggest students utilize open source software tools to scrape web pages of financial institutions or neobanks and then perform analysis to aggregate critical information: APR, fees, minimum balances and other important metrics. Students will gain experience in text aggregation/summarization techniques and other machine learning routines which will have broad applications beyond banking and finance.” (data: web scraping is required)
